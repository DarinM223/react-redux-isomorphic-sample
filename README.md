git-conv: A web application that allows people to ask questions on open source codebases
========================================================================================

One problem that people have when working on open source is that
they don't know whether some piece of code was written badly because
it was a mistake or because the contributor just forgot about it. They
don't want to open an issue over a small style mistake that isn't an
actual bug, but it might be important to clean these things up in terms of quality.

This web application tries to solve this by having an interface for people
to ask questions about small style errors or whether a piece of code can
be written better. People contributing can see all existing questions asked for
a specific line.
